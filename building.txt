Building
---------
If you want to build the code, you'll need to install the Allegro libraries first.
I used version 5.1.8, which I believe is the first version with support for Raspberry Pi.

To install it, I followed this tutorial:
http://joshua14.homelinux.org/blog/?p=1726

Having done this, change to the source directory and run the build script:

cd ~/game/src
./build.sh

Static vs Shared
----------------

The build script will build either an executable which expects shared-object versions of the allegro libraries,
or one which requires, and includes, static versions. The distributed executable (and default config of the 
build script) is statically-linked to allegro, in the hope that this means that end-users don't need to 
install allegro at all. 

If you're building the code, you need to edit the build script to choose static or shared object linking, and
make sure that you built the Allegro5 libraries correspondingly. 

The above tutorial produces shared-object libraries. To build static versions, I think I referred to this:

Good Luck!
