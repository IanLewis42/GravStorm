Building
---------

o Raspberry Pi  
  If you want to build the code, you'll need to install the Allegro libraries first.
  I used version 5.1.8, which I believe is the first version with support for Raspberry Pi.

  To install it, I followed this tutorial:
  http://joshua14.homelinux.org/blog/?p=1726

  There's a pair of #defines at the top of game.h to set the target. Make sure these are:
  #define  RPI 1
  #define  WINDOWS 0
  
  Having done this, change to the source directory and run the build script:

  cd ~/gravstorm/src
  ./build.sh

  Static vs Shared
  The build script will build either an executable which expects shared-object versions of the allegro libraries,
  or one which requires, and includes, static versions. The distributed executable (and default config of the 
  build script) is statically-linked to allegro, in the hope that this means that end-users don't need to 
  install allegro at all. 

  If you're building the code, you need to edit the build script to choose static or shared object linking, and
  make sure that you built the Allegro5 libraries correspondingly. 

  The above tutorial produces shared-object libraries. To build static versions, I think I referred to this:

o Windows
  I use Code:Blocks and MinGW to build under windows. The project file is included (gravstorm.cbp)
  There's a tutorial for setting up allegro for codeblocks here:
  https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Windows,_Code::Blocks_and_Allegro_5
  and a forum thread which includes all the things that weren't in the tutorial here :-)
  https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/616089
  I might update the tutorial if I get around to it....

Good Luck!
