 //Random development notes. Nothing in this file should be taken as an indication of anything other than

//TODO
 //Level 1
 //*ship rotation, movement
 //*scrolling background
 //*bullets - bug with explosion?
 //*collision detection
 //  *ship-to-ship - first pass - BB
 //  *bullet-to-ship - ditto
 //  *bullet-to-wall
 //  *ship-to-wall - seems OK.....
 
 //Level 2
 //*split screen
 //*first level design and -import
 //*status display=>variable mass, ammo etc. - need to calc mass, ammo2, end on lives=0
 //*landing pads
 //*level metadata - start pos, landing pad pos & properties (refuelling etc), water, updrafts.....
 
 //Level 3 - finish TR
 //?sound
 // more sounds (wind, engine, menu sound)
 //*more levels - need to sort out making collision map - all TR levels done
 //*all weapon types
 //*front end menu 
 //  DO this in 3 columns, left col has map names (as now). when you select a map, the next col pops up,
 //  listing players - white if selectable, grey if not (cos too big - read from map text file) *colour* if selected
 //  (could wind profile saving in here maybe...)
 //  Selected player shows key/joystick config in right col. COuld also pick/enter name....
 //  need to read number of USB joysticks. Start p1,p2 keyboard, scroll down through GPIO joystick (commad line option?)
 //  then USBs. Start with p3,p4 N/A as sensible default.
 //*ship config menu
 //  Key handling is more complicated with this - I think the answer is to store more info in ship struct - 
 //  perhaps ship[i].left_pressed, ship[i].left_released (also for right,fire1,fire2 - rename up/down??)
 //  so _pressed is set TRUE by ScanInputs(). Can then be cleared by reading code for one-shot effect,
 //  or cleared by ScanInputs() when released, at which time _released is set.
 //  Hmmm.... sounds like I don't really need _released. 
 //  more detail: Code in main loop processes Allegro event and sets value in pressed_keys[] in even was DOWN,
 //				  clears value in pressed_keys[] in event was UP.
 //               ScanInputs() then maps this across to Ship[] structs.
 //				  ScanInputs also reads GPIO Joystick and puts this info in. Note that SI() clears pressed_keys for fire2.
 //                 and also has a state machine to acheive the same effect for GPIO Joystick.
 //				  UpdateShips() takes the values from ship[] struct, and does stuff accordingly.
 //				  The keys need one-short or continuous depending on menu states, so the 'clever' bit should
 //               be in UpdateShips().
 //               So... how about we keep the main loop code, and add joystick (GPIO & USB?) stuff, 
 //				  so that ship.left etc get set once on press, clear on release, but can be cleared by later code.
 //				  main loop code should be in terms of devices (keys, joystick)
 //				  ScanInputs should carry on doing the mapping.
 //	Messy. better: 
 //	2 key event log arrays, replacing pressed_keys, key_down_log[] & key_up_log[].
 //	Ship struct extended, so we have key_x_down and key_x_held
 //	ScanInputs() sets Ship.key_x_down and Ship.key_x_held when key_down_log[] is set, and then clears key_down_log[]
 //	ScanInputs() clears Ship.key_x_held when key_up_log[] is set, and then clears key_up_log[].
 //	Other code (e.g menu handling) clears Ship.key_x_down on read.
 //	USB joystick should be similar, as it's event based.
 //	Need to generate on/off events for GPIO joystick.
 //	
 //*race
 //  Specify start/finish line as pair of x,y co-ords line must be horizontal or vertical, i.e either x1=x2, or y1=y2.
 //  Read this in, and create 2 areas, before and after line, by extending 'same' coord,
 //  e.g. horizontal line, 100,100 200,100 so areas are 100,90;200,90 plus line coords, and 100,110;200,110 plus line co-ords.
 //  Check (like with special areas) if we are in 'before' area. If we are flag it. If we were in it last time, then check 
 //  for 'after area'. toggle timing on transition. Do timing as float, with increment as 1/30, add this each frame. Ooooh. or 
 //  could use al_get_time. Ah, no, I'd like it to update every frame, so might as well just add on...
 //  DIsplay two times in status bar? running and last lap? - need small font.... 7 seg???

 // Sentry damage shield:
    TR has rapid fire bullets, (max 100) with low damage (3)
       also heavy weapons (max 8) with higher damage (50-80)
       weapons recharge on pads.
       Ship shield starts at 100
       
    Thrust ship has unlimited single shot gun, where 1 hit destroys anything (ship or sentry).
    Close-ish is: *Just use heavy weapons (init ammo to 0/max(8))
                  *Sentry shield = 50 (or less....)
                  Sentry shot damage = 100

 //*max speed for heatseekers? could do via drag?
 // SO Ship max v is 25, I think, as Drag = 2, d*25 = 50 = THRUST.
 // HS max v depends on range (as thrust equivalent is 1/r^2)
 // So to get HS v = 25 @ (say) 100 pixels,
 //HS_ACCN = 50 * 100^2 (for r^2) = 500000 (with same drag as ship)
 //HS_ACCN = 50 * 100 (for (r)  = 5000 (ditto for drag).
 // give it a go....
 //however, ship accn is limited by mass, so net thrust is 50 from 0 velocity,
 //but accn is only ~0.5 (average ship mass = 100)
 //so divide hs by 100? (to get similar performace) or less, 'cos it's lighter
 //but numbers above still give max speed = 25.
 //If you have less drag (say drag/10) then drag = 0.2, 25*d = 5 (cf 50)
 //So HS_ACCN scales with drag. Might as well leave it as ship, it's all in floats anyway.....
 //NB was 70, no drag, 1/r (seemed OK ish....)
 //Still not happy. Too easy to 'break away' as if HS > 100 pixels away, ship thrust is more.
 // So, can we set a maximum on thrust? So still varies with 1/r^2, but gets to ship equivalent at (say) 400 pixels,
 // but never gets more? 
 // Yes! Done this seems good.

 // *pad numbering: currently read into pad array index as we go through text file. This gives home base.
 //  also, home base is given in bottom nibble. This is bad......
 //  Taking home base from index ensures you have 1 of each, but means that the bottom nibble is
 //  effectively ignored.... Using bottom nibble means that you could end up with multiple home bases
 //  (maybe intentional - though you can only reappear at one of them....) or no home bases for some ships...
 //  Like using bottom nibble better. Need yet another entry in Ship struct for home pad...
 //*New heatseeker maths
 
 //Heatseekers
 // gravity-like force, so magnitude is proportional to 1/r^2
 // SO get vector from bullet to (each) ship, x^2 + y^2 = r^2, acceleration = K/r^2
 // need to apply this in the correct direction, so multiply a by x & y,
 // except that yo need to normalise the vector first, so a*x/r, a*y/r.
 // save a division by K*x/(r^3), K*y/(r^3).
 // However, square root may be expensive, so could try CORDIC
 // this gives you r & theta, sinlut[theta], coslut[theta] gives normalised vectar
 // but we do need to divide theta(degrees) by 9 to get LUT index....
 // also need to square and divide by r^2
 //SO: Square, square add sqrt mul div, mul div - sqrt 2 divs
 //OR: CORDIC div LUT LUT square mul div div - CORDIC 3 divs
 //check after getting r / r^2 - skip the rest if it's big, as effect limited.
 //Hmmm.. cordic might be able to do other things....like get sin/cos, though that's starting with the angle....
 //Hurrr.... looks like RPi (ARM11/ARMv6 w/FP (VFPv2) has h/w FP divide and FP sqrt, both taking 14 cycles.
 //  so I might as well use them.....
 // I've just explicitly turned on FP in build script....

 Collision detection
 --------------------
 Will ultimately need pixel-perfect CD, but that's expensive, so limit it.
 Bounding boxes for ship-to-ship seem good, then do PP if BB says yes.
 Or distance? Could do x^2+y^2<80^2 - this is 2 subtractions, 2 multiplies, add and compare
 or do x/y separately would be abs(x1-x2)<80 (sub, abs, compare) same for y. better I think.
 This seems roughly equivalent to BB, but I'm not absolutley sure. 
 If both conditions pass, then go to PP. Take 2 masks, overlap them. Note that I'll need masks 
 for each rotation, which implies sprite sheet rotation, rather than al_ rotation.
 Also note that you just mask the ship, not the flame. 
 
 NO! The collision masks and ship display are completely separate - There's no reason you couldn't keep 
 using al_ rotation for display, and use still collision masks. Angles would have to agree, obvs...
 That said, I think I'll try to do sprite sheet rotation. POV rendering everything looks promising, and 
 Napoleons sprite sheet editor seems to do what I want. (NO! GlueIt much better!)
 
 Bullet-to-ship: do distance compare as above, but can just check for point against mask, 
 as bullets are small. Not absolutely sure how to relate the two though.... Maybe just 40,40 offset from 
 centres? 
  
 Which leaves ship to wall. Ah yes, also bullet to wall. 
 Bullet to wall could be done with BB, but there's a lot of BBs... ah, but not so many tiles.
 Check for which tile bullet's in, lookup tile, then compare position-in-tile (bitmask, as tile size is poewer of 2)
 with tile pixel. Again, only do 1 pixel 'cos bullet is small. Compare alpha values?
 
 
 Ship To Wall
 -----------
 Back to ship-to-wall. Could do something similar, but will be more complicated cos ship can 
 be in more than 1 tile. I s'pose compare ship mask to tile mask, as above, for each tile ship is in.
 Simplify by not checking if tile is empty. Also don't check if tile is full - just declare collision.
 So it's only partly filled tiles that are hard - minimise them! Rubbish! you're always going to collide when 
 the ship and the tile are partly overlapping, so it's a question of whether any non-empty pixels from the ship overlap
 non-empty ones in the tile. If the tile is full, then that might be slightly easier, but not much.
 And genuinely full tiles means dead straight up/down/left/right and therefore quite boring maps.....
 
 Looks like TR maps may not be tiled, so need to load whole bitmap (OK at original TR resolution...)
 and display part of it. (with draw_bitmap_region (possibly scaled)
 
 So if you can get collision map(/tiles) into 1bpp, and then pack 8 pixels into a byte (/32 into an int...)
 and do the same with the sprite collision maps (just the alpha value - of the ship, remember, not the flame)
 Then you can compare 8/16/32 pixels in one go. smart :-) Ah, alignment issues mean it's not that simple.
 
 I'm tentatively happy with displaying TR map x2. Ship size will be something like 50x50. Display / movement is fine (need
 to tweak gravity / thrust / drag). So to do collision, we need to either halve ship coords / mask or double
 collision map/coords. halving ship is bad unless ship size is power of 2, so go for doubling map.
 
 So, we have an array of ints with each bit representing a pixel in the ship. (3x16 = 48, so that might be a good size...)
Say array is 3*48 x U16 (note one array for each rotation - or one big one for all rotations. Not sure which is better/easier).
We have another array of ints which is the same for the collision map. This will be bigger - 640*640 map gives an array of
40*640 x U16

Ignorning doubling/halving for the minute, say ship centre is at 100,100. Ship TopLeft is at 76,76. So I need to AND the first 
word in the ship array with the bits from row 76 of the array, starting with b12 in word 4. 
I can get to row 76 easily, and word 4 comes from 76>>4. b12 is 76&FF. 
So, take word from ship array, promote to 32 bit, LS by 16, then RS by 12 (combine, obvs). Split into 2 U16s, and compare
these with w4 and w5 from the map array.
I then need word 2 from the ship array. This needs to be checked against w5/w6 with the same shifting (I think), then word 3 /6&7
Repeat for next 47 rows.

If the map was stored as 32 bits, then I could halve the word index (so lword 2)do the shift and directly compare, I think.
Ah, well yes, but only half the time. There will still be times when the 16bit word overlaps a 32bit boundary. So don't bother.

Now consider double scaling. If ship centre is at 100,100, this corresponds to 50,50 on the tr map. TL will be 76,76 = 38,38 on tr map.
If we store the collision map as 640 rows, but 1280 columns, with each bit/pixel duplicated, we double the size of the array, to 80*640
but can do the compare as above. We need to use row 38, but all other calcs are the same. Also, we only do this for 24 rows. 
I can't see an easy way to avoid doing this on every pass. Effort involved is:

For each ship, on every frame:
 Calc TL (2Xsub from centre pos)
 RS to get halved row.
 RS to get word in row
 mask to get bit in word
 x24
 	x3
 		Read word
 		Shift, split	;store map as 32 => no split, 1x AND? No, well, yes, but only half the time.
 		2xAND			;so on average you'll save mips, but the extra complication prob isn't worth it.
 		compare to zero
 end
 
 Hopefully doable....
 
 Alternative approach: for double scaling, you need a ship mask which is 24x24, not 48x48.
 You can store ship mask in 32bit words (24 long ints)
 If you also store map mask in 32s, then you need 1 or 2 compares per row.
 Ship mask will be left-aligned. 
 So say ship is at 100,100 (centre) - this is 50,50 for collisions. SO we need to move the centre to 50. This is 18 pixels in to 
 so we need to compare map 18 to ship 0. this means shift right by 18, then AND ship with map. we then need to take next map word, 
 and AND with ship LS so that bottom 18 bits are compared, - this is LS by (32-18=) 14.
 
 
 If we were further in, say 500, that's 250, 
 which is 7*32=224 + 26, so take map word 7(6) and compare to ship right shift by 26, then word 8 to ship LS by 8.
 
 For a small first shift, say the ship is at 66->33, we take map word 2(1) and compare to ship rs by 1. We would then,
 as above, compare next map word to ship ls by 31. as this is >23, there's no point, so don't bother.
 
 Repeat this for 24 rows, but shifts are the same for each row :-).
 

 
 Ship to ship:
 -------------
 First do bounding box, iff that collides, then:
 
  ShipSize - mod(y1-y2) = number of rows to check = nr
  start with top row in lower y. Start with nr up from bottow row in upper y.
  ShipSize - mod(x1-x2) = number of cols to check = nc
  
   
  if 16 >= nc 
  	take bigger x, lookup 1st word in ship mask, LS by nc%16 (simpler)
  	AND with 3rd word in smaller x
  
    
  if 32 >= nc >= 16
  	take bigger x, lookup 1st word in ship mask, promote to 32bit. LS by nc%16
  	  take 2nd and 3rd word from smaller x, combine into 32 bit (just grab from array via cast?? - alignment??)
  	  AND  32 bit things together 
  	
  	take bigger x, lookup 2nd word in ship mask, LS by nc%16 (simpler)
  	  AND with 3rd word in smaller x    
  
  
  if 48 >= nc >= 32
  	take bigger x, lookup 1st word in ship mask, LS by nc%16
  	  take 1st and 2nd word from smaller x, combine into 32 bit (just grab from array via cast?? - alignment??)
  	  AND  32 bit things together 
   	  	
  	take bigger x, lookup 2nd word in ship mask, LS by nc%16
  	  take 2nd and 3rd word from smaller x, combine into 32 bit (just grab from array via cast?? - alignment??)
  	  AND  32 bit things together     
  	
  	take bigger x, lookup 3rd word in ship mask, LS by nc%16(simpler)
  	  AND with 3rd word in smaller x
  	  
should be able to wind this into a for loop (reverse order of steps?)
