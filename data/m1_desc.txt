MISSION 1

Your objective is to rescue the miners who are 
stuck at the bottom of the cave system. Land on 
the 'blue' pads to rescue them. Land on the 'red' 
pads to collect jewels for bonus points. Beware 
that your ship will be heavier with extra passengers 
and cargo! Fly off away from the surface to complete 
the level.
