INSTRUCTIONS:

Fly around, shoot your enemy, don't crash into the walls :-)

If it's a mission level, rescue miners, and pick up bonus 
jewels by landing on the pads. Fly off away from the surface 
to complete the level.

Default controls are:
 Player 1: Cursors and Right Ctrl
 Player 2: Q A R T and Left Alt
 Escape: back/exit
 
Right and Left rotate the ship clockwise and anti-clockwise.
Up/Forwards fires your 'normal' weapon (rapid fire, low damage)
Down/Back fires your 'special' weapon (limited ammo, more damage, 
various types)
Thrust/Joystick Button fires your engine.

In network play only, F10 will toggle a 'radar' display at the 
top-right of the screen, showing the terrain, and all ships.

At the top-left of each player's window there is a status panel 
for their ship. 
[status]        
                       Shield
                       Normal Ammo
                       Special Ammo
                       Fuel
                       Ships left

Current, last completed and best lap times are displayed at the 
bottom of the panel.

For 'Mission' levels, miners rescued and jewels collected are 
shown, along with the elapsed time.

If you press Down/Fire2 when on your landing pad, a config menu 
will appear. This lets you choose how much fuel you carry, and 
how much and what types of ammunition.
